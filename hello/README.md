# CalComp 2810 Z80 test proggies

As seen on YouTube!  https://youtu.be/D_t7OZF6RzM

These are some simple sanity-check apps that can be used to test the Intel hex file read
command on the CalComp 2810 CPU MOSS ROM monitor.

These require the use of `z80asm` and `srec_cat` as can be installed on Debian style Linux
systems like this:

```
suao apt install z80asm srecord
```
